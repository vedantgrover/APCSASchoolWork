/**
 * Project 3.6.5
 *
 * The Memory Game shows a random sequence of "memory strings" in a variety of buttons.
 * After wathcing the memory strings appear in the buttons one at a time, the
 * player recreates the sequence from memory.
 */

Example of flow of play:

The GUI (Graphical User Interface - like a popup game window) will display three grey boxes, oriented horizontally.
The GUI welcomes the player with a popup box
The GUI prompts the player to play
The GUI flashes a sequence of strings in a random grey boxes: flash: s - left box, flash: a - right box, flash: a - middle box
The GUI prompts the user for the sequence of strings
The GUI congratulates or admonishes the player
The player plays as many times as they want
If the player quits, display the score. 

Notes: 
The instructions (in the MemoryGame.java class) are a bit spartan and cryptic, but remember, the ultimate goal is to get the game functioning
as described in the example flow of play.
Your game logic will be built in the MemoryGame.java class - no bootstrapper class necessary
Read the GUI methods carefully. You may not need to build in logic where some already exists. 
You will need RandomPermutation.java from Friday as a part of your project. It is critical in random array creation.

Goal Day 1:
Make sense of the GUI methods.
