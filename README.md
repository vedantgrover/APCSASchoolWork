# APCSASchoolWork

This is all of my school work from my AP CSA Class.

While I do have this code up, please do not copy it word for word. Understand the code and then think about putting your own little twist to it.

# My Thoughts on the Class
AP CSA is one of my favorite AP Classes. The biggest things is studying Java Syntax and learning how to build logic. I would definitely recommend taking AP CSP before just 
so you have better background info on Computers and the way they work. The Work load is not too bad although some of the projects and supplements were definitely a little harder.

Overall the class was extremely enjoyable and would defintely recommend to anyone who wants to be a Computer Scientist

# Other Stuff
This project contains multiple folders each with their own code. I have a little bit of Python experience so you will probably see some Python in there. I was learning some HTML
and have some of that code in here as well. The Formatter tab was just a place for me to put code and format it with Shift + Alt + F (Formatter shortcut for VSC). If you do want to look through and take a couple of methods or copy some logic bits, go ahead. Just make sure you understand how it works. AP CSA is big on building
logic and so understanding how different methods or variables interact with each other is important if you want to truly enjoy the class.

I had a lot of fun in this class. I hope you do too. Enjoy!

Have Fun and Don't die,
